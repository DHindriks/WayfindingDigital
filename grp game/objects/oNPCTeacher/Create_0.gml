NPCDialogue[0, 0] = "Hello Henry, and welcome to The Hanze. I hope your journey to The Netherlands was pleasant. My name is Professor Nico peter Christian but everyone calls me professor NPC, and I am the headmaster of this high school. Here at Hanze we prioritize getting to know our students by expanding their ideas, beliefs and what they value throughout their study. We give them the tools and opportunities so that they can take the everchanging world by the horns after they complete their studies. There are a few things that you could do before you get started and luckily enough today is International Culture day, so it is not a normal day here at the Hanze. A lot of our students will be wearing traditional clothing and have been asked to bring items that belong to their culture or heritage to share with each other. We hold this event every year at the Hanze and it's a fantastic way to build rapport and learn more about your student's cultures, as this is important rite of passage for new teachers at Hanze. This event truly highlights that we are an international university and we proudly live up to this each year.";
