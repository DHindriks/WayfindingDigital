The World Cup for soccer has recently started, and watching my country play their matches has gotten me motivated to get better at it myself. Thanks Henry, I owe you. Well, now that my stress has been taken care of, this is the Glitch office. On this school we have something called Glitch which is an association that organises awesome events for the students while also getting to travel together. Their office is a fun place to hang out. You can nap on the couch, play games together on the TV and just ask feedback on your own projects!";
