NPCDialogue[0, 0] = "Did you manage to find some Chinese items?";
NPCDialogue[0, 1] = "I found some" + "01";
NPCDialogue[0, 2] = "Not yet" + "02";

NPCDialogue[2, 0] = "They have to be around here somewhere.";

NPCDialogue[1, 0] = "Ah, the Chinese flag. My father used to serve in Chinese military. He taught me the meaning of the flag.  In history, China was occupied by eight different countries. The Eight-Nation Alliance, I believe it was";
NPCDialogue[1, 1] = "How did that influence the flag's design?" + "03";

NPCDialogue[3, 0] = "The red background represents the revolution. The stars represent the unity of Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. My father never liked foreign people. He was even resisting my idea of going abroad to study. He thought there are only violence and prejudice outside China.";
NPCDialogue[3, 1] = "That's prejudice itself. That doesn't make sense. Nobody likes violence and prejudice." + "04";
NPCDialogue[3, 2] = "Understandable. If your father had never been to another country, he might be thinking that way." + "06";

// 3 option 1
NPCDialogue[4, 0] = "It's true. But I can't blame him. His grandfather was killed during the war. Plus, he didn't know what it is really like in another country.";
NPCDialogue[4, 1] = "Didn't he watch news?" + "05";

NPCDialogue[5, 0] = "Yeah, but, do you know that almost every positive news you can find on Chinese websites and other medias is related to China, while neutral and negative news are related to other countries? So I can't blame him for thinking about other countries that way.";
NPCDialogue[5, 1] = "I also found this, this lantern looks like it has a Chinese design." + "07";

// 3 option 2
NPCDialogue[6, 0] = "No, he hadn't. He spent all his life in China. He strongly disapproved my studying abroad. Yet here I am. I guess all kids rebel their parents, huh?";
NPCDialogue[6, 1] = "I also found this, this lantern looks like it has a Chinese design." + "07";

NPCDialogue[7, 0] = "The red lantern. In China, it is mostly used during the Chinese Luna Year. I'm from the rural area in China, I've seen that a lot.  My father used to teach me how to make the red lantern, every year before the Chinese Luna Year.";
NPCDialogue[7, 1] = "So these lanterns symbolize the Chinese new year?" + "08";

NPCDialogue[8, 0] =  "They represent happiness, luck, brightness, and wealth in Chinese culture. My father used to hang two small lanterns in front of my room. He always told me not to take them down. He believed they can bring me good luck and help me grow up.";
NPCDialogue[8, 1] =  "That makes no sense. That's superstition" + "09";
NPCDialogue[8, 2] =  "That's so nice of him: He obviously cared a lot about you" + "10";

NPCDialogue[9, 0] =  "My father was not well educated. He just loved me in his own way. And I kind of like it. He meant well, and that's all I needed";
NPCDialogue[9, 1] =  "I also found this, Is this a Chinese item." + "11";

NPCDialogue[10, 0] =  "Yeah. Superstition, of course, but it's just his way of loving me.";
NPCDialogue[10, 1] =  "I also found this, Is this a Chinese item." + "11";

NPCDialogue[11, 0] =  "Yes, a hot pot. It's like a fondue, but, instead of having cheese, it's boiling meat slices, vegetables, noodles everything on the dinner table, and dip them in some special sauce. My father loved it. With some beer, he could eat the whole world. But that's also what caused his gout. Research shows that you can intake purine more than ten times of those from regular food after a hot pot meal. Nevertheless, hot pots are very popular in China. Especially in Sichuan province and Chungking. There's even a special type of hot pot, the hot pot chicken. It's from Cangzhou, Hebei province";
NPCDialogue[11, 1] =  "Sounds good. I assume it's delicious." + "12";
NPCDialogue[11, 2] =  "Sounds strange. I'm not sure if I'm going to try it." + "13";

NPCDialogue[12, 0] =  "For most Chinese people, yeah. Almost everyone in China likes hot pots. My father used to have hot pots regularly. But I'm one of those people who don't like it. I find it too greasy.";
NPCDialogue[12, 1] =  "That's all the Chinese items I've managed to find, do these help you open the box?" + "14";
NPCDialogue[13, 0] =  "Maybe. Even in China, there are people who don't like hot pots. After all, it's not really healthy.";
NPCDialogue[13, 1] =  "That's all the Chinese items I've managed to find, do these help you open the box?" + "14"

NPCDialogue[14, 0] = "Thanks for your help. Now I think they're the right elements and I can crack the box open now. Here, I found this card in my box. I don't know what it is, but I feel like you need it more than I do.";
