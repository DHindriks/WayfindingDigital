NPCDialogue[1, 0] = "That's good I am glad, my friend. You are a new teacher, that is fantastic! I hope that you enjoy teaching here as much as I enjoy learning at Hanze. Life is all about learning in my eyes.";
NPCDialogue[1, 1] = "I understand..." + "09";

NPCDialogue[2, 0] = "That is the joy of learning, my friend. Everything is hard the first time we try but we all have the capability within us to aspire. For you that may to be a great teacher one day. For me I want to design beautiful art for people.";

NPCDialogue[3, 0] = "Ah Mr. Henry do not be afraid; I get a good feeling that you will do great with your teachings. I can just tell from talking with you that you mean well. However, I would say that some people need to be taught some manners around here though…";

NPCDialogue[6, 0] = "Well some people were laughing at me earlier and I overheard them say that my belgha slippers and my keffiyeh scarf looked really stupid. It upset me so much that I am too embarrassed to wear them in front of anyone right now.";
NPCDialogue[6, 1] = "Ah I'm sorry that you went through that Youssef. People can be so immature when it comes to clothing or culture that they aren't used to. Thank you for telling me this. Would you like me to escalate this higher?" + "07";

NPCDialogue[7, 0] = " It's okay, my friend this is not the first time this has happened to me, I realise people think it's silly, but I know that they are just shallow and not open to change. They will stay that way for life."; 
NPCDialogue[7, 1] = "I'm going to get your shoes and your scarf Youssef and I want you to wear them and be proud of your culture. We're all here to learn about culture today. Will you wear them?" + "08";

NPCDialogue[9, 0] = "I understand what you mean, teaching and learning are how we shape the future world and it's the reason I became a teacher. think it's soimportant that I teach my students this lesson of shaping the world. I only have a short amount of time before they enter their careers and I want them to know that they can do literally anything if they apply their skills correctly.";
NPCDialogue[9, 1] = "It worries me a little that I won't achieve this" + "03";
